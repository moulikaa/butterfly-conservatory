		<p>This is a page about the butterfly conservatory that I went to at the beginning of September! It was a lot of fun and we say many different kinds of butterflies and got to walk through a beautiful garden filled with colourful flowers. We also got to walk through the conservatory while the butterflies flew around us. This is one of the only clear shots I got of a butterfly because any time we went near one, it would fly away (understandably)</p>
